## Skip List
In computer science, a skiplist is data structurehat allows search complexity as well as insertion complexity within an ordered sequence of elements. Thus it can get the best features of an array(for searching) while maintaining a linked like structure that allows insertion- which is not possible in an array. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one.
